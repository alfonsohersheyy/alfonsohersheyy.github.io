        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Hey there! My name is Hershey Alfonso, and I am currently 20 years old. 
            I am born and raised in the vibrant City of Mandaluyong, a place that has shaped much of who am I today. 
            I am a second year college student pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology.</p>

        <p>Beyond my academic pursuits, I have discovered to myself that I have quite a deep fondness for reading. 
            Books have become a significant part of my life, offering both an escape and a chance to expand 
            my understanding of the world. Whether I am lost reading a novel or exploring an informative text, 
            reading gives me a sense of fulfillment and personal growth.</p>
