            <p>During the pandemic, amid times of boredom and limited activities, I discovered a newfound interest in reading. 
                This activity became a hobby that I deeply enjoyed during moments of solitude. Even after quarantine restrictions were lifted 
                and circumstances gradually returned to normal, I continued to set aside time for reading, whether through 
                digital platforms or physical books.</p>
